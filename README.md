# Java--

A joke created after having coffee with a fellow engineer. Java-- is taking Java in a different direction by using highly opinionated choices as to what should or should not be used from the core language. Java-- is not a new language, it's just a collection of tools that let you work with Java in a different way.

## Manual Install

For manual install create a folder somewhere in your filesystem with the jmm.sh file inside it. I put mine in a folder called `~/.jmm`.

Or if you have git installed, then just clone it:

    git clone git@github.com:ricallinson/jmm.git ~/.jmm

To activate jmm, you need to source it from your shell:

    source ~/.gwm/gwm.sh

I always add this line to my _~/.bashrc_, _~/.profile_, or _~/.zshrc_ file to have it automatically sourced upon login.
